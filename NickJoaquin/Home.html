Nick Joaquin has also enriched the English language with critics coining <i class="highlight">“Joaquinesque”</i> to describe his baroque Spanish-flavored English or his reinventions of English based on Filipinisms. Aside from his handling of language, Bienvenido Lumbera writes that Nick Joaquin’s significance in Philippine literature involves his exploration of the Philippine colonial past under Spain and his probing into the psychology of social changes as seen by the young, as exemplified in stories such as <i class="highlight">Doña Jeronima</i>, <i class="highlight">Candido’s Apocalypse</i> and <i class="highlight">The Order of Melchizedek</i>. Nick Joaquin has written plays, novels, poems, short stories and essays including reportage and journalism.

		        <h2>A Brief Story of Nick Joaquin's Life</h2>

		        <div class="life-text">
		            <h3 id="lifeandfam">Life and Family</h3>
		            <p>
                		Nicomedes "Nick" Joaquin y Marquez, also known as "Onching," was born on May 4, 1917, in Paco, Manila. He was the fifth child of Don Leocadio Joaquin and Salomé Marquez. Don Leocadio, a colonel, fought in the Philippine Revolution and retired after being wounded. Salomé Marquez, a well-educated woman, taught in a Manila public school. The Joaquin family lived in a two-story residential and commercial building on Herran Street in Paco, Manila. Joaquin had a happy childhood, being tutored in Spanish and piano and encouraged to have an interest in the arts. The family communicated in Spanish and heard mass regularly.
                	<br><br>
						Don Leocadio lost the family fortune in the late 1920s due to a failed oil exploration project. The family moved out of their Herran home and moved into a rented house in Pasay. Don Leocadio passed away soon after, leaving Joaquin at twelve years old.
					<br><br>
						Joaquin deeply admired José Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, paying him tribute in such books as The Storyteller's New Medium: Rizal in Saga, The Complete Poems and Plays of Jose Rizal, and A Question of Heroes: Essays in Criticism on Ten Key Figures of Philippine History. He translated the hero's valedictory poem, in the original Spanish Mi Ultimo Adios, as "Land That I Love, Farewell!".
					<br><br>
						Unfortunately, Joaquin died of cardiac arrest in the early morning of April 29, 2004, at his home in San Juan, Metro Manila. He was then editor of Philippine Graphic magazine, where he worked with Juan P. Dayang, the magazine's first publisher. Joaquin was also publisher of its sister publication, Mirror Weekly, a women's magazine, and wrote the column “Small Beer” for the Philippine Daily Inquirer and Isyu, an opinion tabloid.

		            <p>
                		Nick Joaquin, a former teacher, dropped out of Mapa High School in his third year due to the confined classroom environment and preferred learning outside. He worked as an apprentice in a bakery in Pasay and later at the publishing company TVT, which provided him with a small taste of the industry he would spend most of his life in. Joaquin was an avid reader, with his sister-in-law, Sarah K. Joaquin, describing him as having a "rabid and insane love for books."
                	<br><br>
						His parents encouraged his interest in books from a young age, and he had a borrower's card at the National Library when he was ten. He read extensively, enjoying the works of Edna St. Vincent Millay, Vachel Lindsay, Anton Chekhov, Dostoyevsky, D. H. Lawrence, and Willa Cather. He also read American magazines and discovered the fiction of Booth Tarkington, Somerset Maugham, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway.

		            <p>
                		At 17, Joaquin published his first English poem about Don Quixote in the pre-World War II Tribune, where he worked as a proofreader. He identified with the character and later used the pen names Quijano de Pacó and Quijano de Manila. In 1937, he published his first short story, "The Sorrows of Vaudeville," in the Sunday Tribune Magazine.
                	<br><br>
						After winning a nationwide essay competition to honor La Naval de Manila, sponsored by the Dominican Order, Joaquin was awarded an honorary Associate in Arts (A.A.) and a scholarship to St. Albert's Convent, the Dominican monastery in Hong Kong. He returned to Manila after two years in Hong Kong.
					<br><br>
						Joaquin continued publishing stories and poems between 1934 and 1941 in the Herald Mid-Week Magazine and the Sunday Tribune Magazine. The Commonwealth years were a vibrant era in Philippine literature, but the Japanese occupation closed down the Tribune and other publications. Despite the occupation, Joaquin continued writing, with his work appearing in the Philippine Review in 1943. His story "It Was Later Than We Thought" and translation of Rizal's Mi Ultimo Adios were published, sparking interest from readers. However, he shied away from recognition, creating a mysterious and distant author.
					<br><br>
						In 1957, Joaquin represented the Philippines at the International PEN Congress and was appointed as a member of the Motion Pictures Commission. He was honored as a National Artist and worked for intellectual freedom, securing the release of imprisoned writer José F. Lacaba. Joaquin delivered an invocation to Maria Makiling, a diwata and the mountain's mythical maiden, at a ceremony attended by First Lady Imelda Marcos. After returning to the Philippines, he joined the Philippines Free Press and gained attention for his poems, stories, plays, and journalism under the pen name Quijano de Manila. His intellectual and provocative journalism raised the country's level of reporting.
